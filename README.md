# How to Design Reusable Page Objects Framework using Design Patterns

This project demonstrates how to apply various design patterns such as factory, strategy, command, template, proxy, execute around method, and decorator to design a Test automation framework.

## What are Page Objects?

Page Objects is a design pattern that is widely used in UI Automation testing. It separates the Page Objects and the tests. Page Objects are a representation of the web pages in an application, and they are created to encapsulate the page elements and the operations that can be performed on those elements.

## Steps to Design a Reusable Page Objects Framework

### 1. Define the Page Object Model (POM)

The first step in designing a reusable Page Objects Framework is to define the Page Object Model. The POM defines the objects and the methods that can be used to interact with the UI elements on a web page. The POM should be designed in such a way that it is reusable across multiple test cases.

### 2. Identify the Common Functionalities

The next step is to identify the common functionalities that can be reused across different pages. For example, logging in, logging out, navigating to a page, etc. These common functionalities can be implemented using design patterns such as the template pattern or the execute around method pattern.

### 3. Implement the Design Patterns

Once the common functionalities have been identified, the next step is to implement the design patterns that are required to achieve the desired functionality. For example, the factory pattern can be used to create Page Objects, the strategy pattern can be used to switch between different strategies for performing the same action, and the decorator pattern can be used to add additional functionality to an existing object.

### 4. Build the Framework

The next step is to build the framework by implementing the POM and the design patterns. The framework should be designed in such a way that it is easy to maintain, and the code should be organized in a structured manner.

### 5. Test the Framework

Once the framework has been built, the next step is to test it. The framework should be tested to ensure that it is working as expected, and all the functionalities are implemented correctly.

### 6. Refactor and Optimize

Finally, once the framework has been tested, the next step is to refactor and optimize it. This involves identifying any areas of the code that can be improved or optimized and making the necessary changes to improve the performance of the framework.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, designing a reusable Page Objects Framework requires a good understanding of the POM and the design patterns. By following the steps outlined in this document, it is possible to design a robust and reusable framework that can be used across multiple test cases.
